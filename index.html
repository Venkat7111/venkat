  From Feeling Lost To Finding Logic — <em>My Coding Journey Begins</em>. What once felt like an impossible task became a path of understanding as I shifted from memorizing to truly learning the logic behind C programming.
</p>
			<p>When I first began learning to code, I felt completely lost. The C language seemed like an entirely different world, and I started to doubt whether programming was even meant for me. My initial approach was to memorize everything — every line, every function — hoping that would be enough to get me through. But I quickly realized that coding isn’t about memorizing syntax; it’s about understanding logic and solving problems creatively.</p>

<p>During my first-year Mid-1 exams, I struggled a lot. While many of my friends could confidently answer questions, I felt stuck and unsure of even the basic concepts. I didn’t truly understand how C worked, and in my desperation, I resorted to memorizing programs just to pass. It was frustrating and discouraging.</p>

<p>But everything changed just two days before one of my important exams. I made a decision to stop memorizing and instead start truly understanding the subject. I turned to online resources like Stack Overflow, YouTube, and channels like Jenny’s Lectures. These platforms became my virtual classroom. I began to understand the "why" behind the code — how loops work, what conditionals really mean, how functions are structured, and the importance of arrays and pointers.</p>

<p>As I continued to learn, things started to click. For the first time, I felt the joy of truly understanding programming concepts. I no longer feared loops or conditionals — I enjoyed working with them. Debugging stopped being a headache and became a fun challenge. I began solving problems on my own, and every small success boosted my confidence.</p>

<p>By shifting my mindset from memorization to genuine learning, I not only passed my exams — I developed a strong foundation in C. I now feel proud of this journey. It wasn’t just about getting marks; it was about embracing the struggle, changing my approach, and proving to myself that I could learn and grow. Coding no longer feels like a burden — it feels like a skill I’ve truly earned.</p>

  From Curiosity To Confidence — <em>My Python Journey Unfolds</em>. What began as an easy choice turned into a deep passion, as I explored real-world problems and built projects that shaped my programming path.
</p>

			<p>
  After completing the C language, I decided to switch to Python. At first, I felt it was an easy language — its syntax is clean and simple. But as I started exploring more complex problems and real-world user cases, I realized that Python also has its depth and challenges.
</p>

<p>
  Despite the complexities, I chose Python as my main programming language. Its easy syntax and widespread use in data science, machine learning, and generative AI made it the perfect choice for me. In my first year, I also completed the Microsoft Student Ambassador program, which helped me gain a lot of knowledge and experience.
</p>

<p>
  YouTube became my university — I learned a lot by watching videos and practicing on my mobile. This made it easy for me to develop with Python even without a laptop. I began to enjoy the language more and more, especially because of the huge number of libraries and community support available.
</p>

<p>
  I realized that while everyone says Python is easy, implementing basic concepts into complex programs is where the real learning begins. I learned to write simple user interfaces, apply logical thinking, and work on small projects that built my confidence and skills.
</p>

<p>
  I even did an internship with "Vault of Codes," which was another milestone in my journey. I built basic projects like a calculator, a band name generator, and a number guessing game. Each project brought a sense of joy and achievement when I saw the output working successfully.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve grown very attached to Python — I often say it's like my girlfriend because I truly love it. It’s been more than just a language; it’s been a companion in my coding journey, helping me grow from a beginner to a confident developer.

  Building Blocks of the Web — <em>How HTML Became My Foundation</em>. What started with simple tags and forms soon became the core of my understanding in web development, giving me the confidence to explore the world of programming.
</p>

<p>
  When I started learning HTML, I felt like I had found the easiest language used in programming. It made me believe that programming could be simple and enjoyable. For many beginners, HTML gives that first feeling of confidence — that they can learn to code. I also felt that way. I thought if I could understand HTML, then cracking any programming language would become easier.
</p>

<p>
  At first, I didn’t try to memorize every tag. I realized early on that memorizing is a waste of time — what matters is understanding the structure and knowing how to use documentation when needed. Instead of rote learning, I focused on learning by doing. I began creating small elements like tables and forms, and slowly built confidence by seeing them execute perfectly in the browser. That made me really happy — I could actually build something and see it live!
</p>

<p>
  I used VS Code, which made writing HTML simpler thanks to its auto-formatting and suggestions. It helped me build layouts quickly and understand the flow of tags like <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, and so on. I also attended a workshop in my college. In the morning, it was mostly theory and concepts, but in the afternoon, we had hands-on practice. That was when everything clicked for me. I started using HTML even at home, and it became part of my daily routine.
</p>

<p>
  One of the things I loved most was learning how to embed a YouTube video using an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. That made HTML even more exciting — it was like magic to see a video play directly from a few lines of code. I also experimented with inline CSS and made my content colorful, which made my heart feel joyful.
</p>

<p>
  For me, HTML wasn’t just a subject — it was the first victory I experienced in programming. It gave me the confidence that I could conquer more languages in the future. It taught me the foundation of how websites are structured and how frontend development works, and for that, I’ll always be grateful.
